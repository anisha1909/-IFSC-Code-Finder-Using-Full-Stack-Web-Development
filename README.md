# IFSC Code Finder Using Full Stack Web Development
 

Objective:  
To design and develop a user-friendly web application that allows users to search for and retrieve information about bank IFSC (Indian Financial System Code) codes using PHP as the backend technology.  

Project Description:  
The IFSC Code Finder is a full-stack web application that enables users to search for IFSC codes of banks across India by entering details such as the bank name, branch name, or state. 
 Key Features:  
1. Search Functionality: 
   - Users can search by bank name, branch name, or state to retrieve the corresponding IFSC code.  

2. Dynamic Frontend Interface:  
   - An intuitive and responsive user interface designed using HTML, CSS.  

3. PHP Backend Logic: 
   - The backend is implemented in PHP to handle user requests, query the database, and return relevant IFSC code details.  

4. Database Integration:  
   - A MySQL database stores bank details, including IFSC codes, bank names, branch names, and locations.  
   - The application queries this database to fetch accurate results.  

5. Error Handling:  
   - Proper error messages for invalid searches or database connectivity issues to enhance user experience.  

6. Real-time Data Fetching:  
   - Optimized queries ensure fast retrieval of IFSC codes, even for large datasets.  

7. Deployment:  
   - Hosted on a local server using XAMPP.  

 Key Outcomes:  
- Designed a functional web application for efficient IFSC code search.  
- Demonstrated expertise in full-stack development, including frontend and backend integration.  
- Developed a scalable solution that can handle large datasets and high user traffic.  

Tools and Technologies Used:  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional frameworks like Bootstrap for styling)  
- Backend: PHP  
- Database: MySQL  
- Server: XAMPP (for local testing)
